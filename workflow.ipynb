    "1. Pull the SRTM DEM corresponding to your study area from EarthAccess -OR- load an existing reference DEM of your choosing \n",

    "- a NASA EarthData login to download the SRTM elevation data. EarthData can be accessed at the following link: (https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/oauth/authorize?client_id=ZAQpxSrQNpk342OR77kisA&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/login&state=/)\n",

    "We use `earthaccess`, an open source package developed by Luis Lopez to allow easy search of the NASA Common Metadata Repository (CMR) and download of NASA data collections. It can be used for programmatic search and access for both _DAAC-hosted_ and _cloud-hosted_ data. It manages authenticating using Earthdata Login credentials. `earthaccess` can be used to find and access both DAAC-hosted and cloud-hosted data in just **three** lines of code.  See [https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess)."
