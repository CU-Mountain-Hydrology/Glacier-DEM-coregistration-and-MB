# Glacier-DEM-coregistration-and-MB

This repository contains a jupyter-notebook tutorial for: 
1. DEM co-registration, following the Nuth and Kääb (2011) workflow
2. Clipping DEMs to the glacier area polygons of your choice
3. Differencing DEMs
4. Computing mean annual glacier mass balance 

Example DEMs (Instituto Geográfico Militar, 1954; SRTM, 2000; UAV 2024) and glacier polyons (Dirección General de Aguas 2014; 2019) are provided for the Nevados de Chillán Volcanic complex in Ñuble, Chile
