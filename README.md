# Glacier-DEM-coregistration-and-MB

This repository contains a jupyter-notebook tutorial for: 
1. Downloading SRTM DEMs from NASA's earthaccess
2. Co-registration additional DEMs with SRTM, following the Nuth and Kääb (2011) workflow
3. Clipping co-registered DEMs to the glacier area polygons of your choice
4. Differencing DEMs
5. Computing mean annual glacier mass balance 

Example DEMs (Instituto Geográfico Militar, 1954; SRTM, 2000; UAV 2024) and glacier polyons (Dirección General de Aguas 2014; 2019) are provided for the Nevados de Chillán Volcanic complex in Ñuble, Chile
